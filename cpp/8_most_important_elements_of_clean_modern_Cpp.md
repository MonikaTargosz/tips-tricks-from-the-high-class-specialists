## 8 Most important elements of a clean and modern C++ language

1. Use simple, meaningful and descriptive names that improve readability in code.

2. Write self-documenting code. 

3. Use domain names. The domain-driven design (DDD) method allows business domain elements and issues to be mapped into code, facilitating communication between developers and other stakeholders. 

4 Choose names at the right level of abstraction. The primary criterion for creating components and classes is the business domain using the DDD method and the object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) technique.

5. Avoid redundancy (DRY principle) by avoiding repetition of the class name in its attributes and not including the attribute type in its name.

6. Avoid puzzling abbreviations and instead use full and easy to pronounce words to name variables or constants.

7. Avoid Hungarian notation and prefixes for naming variables in software, as they can impair code readability and cause problems when modifying the variable type.

8. Avoid using the same name for different purposes, as it can lead to mistakes and disorientation when reading code.
